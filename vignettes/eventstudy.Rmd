The attached sample data and request files were constructed to illustrate the use of the EventStudyTools R-package. 

The files hold data about the addition of several well known firms to the S&P 500 index in the late 1990s. With this data, the R package will investigate for you the question whether a company's stock value increases if the firm is added to the S&P 500 index. This is a common research question and has been adressed, among others, by Anthony W. Lynch and Richard R. Mendenha in a 1997 study: They found a positive effect of about 3.8% over the period starting the day after the announcement and ending the day before the effective date of the change.

You can use our R-package to easily investigate such and similar questions.
